This is a host header injection with a password token you will need to intercept.

- When you first login you are given credentials to use throughtout the application. username: admin@sheridancollege.ca. password: sheridaniscool1234

- You will attempt to login. You will get a result of "Invalid password or email"

- You must figure out the /register route. You can do this by looking for clues such as. (index page has register there and hint.)

- In the register page you will enter the same login and password that was given to you.

- You will get an error. But it tells you to check the login page. Navigate back to it

- You will come to see a new link "Forgot your password?"

- This is an important page. In this /resetpassword route you will enter the username from the start. Now before submitting, you will open burp suite and 2 terminals.

- Turn intercept on and hit submit on the webpage. You will be greeted with info. 

- On terminal 1 - run pythom -m http.server 8989

- On terminal 2 - Install Ngrok - run ngrok --scheme http https 8989

- now change the Host header in burp suite to the forwarding URL in ngrok. 

- Forward the burp suite interception. if done correctly you will see the token pop up in the python server.

- get that token and input it into the URL like so: /resetpassword?token= TOKEN HERE

- then you are brought to a different route /change_password, here you will change your password to anything.

- Once thats done, you will have been greeted with a page stating "flag here". Open up burp suite again. intercept on. refresh the page. send that page to the repeater.
  hit send and you will see the flag in the response header.
