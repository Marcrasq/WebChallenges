Flask cookie forgery:

Type a word from the text, the website will hint if you're on the right path

Once it says you can go further, take the session cookies and decode it and analyze

goal is to change "auth" empty to "admin". 

get a wordlist of the site using cewl, or manually entering key words.

brute force using "flask-unsign --unsign --cookie < cookie.txt --wordlist wordlist.txt" (this will brute force into the secret key)

with the secret key we do "flask-unsign --sign --cookie "{'auth':'admin'}" --secret cream (you will get a forged cookie)

With the forged cookie input into websites current cookie then refresh page for flag
